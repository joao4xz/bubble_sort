# Bubble Sort

## Description
This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum. It implements the bubble sort algorithm through a method called `bubble_sort` that takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns the array sorted in ascending order. Bubble sort works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.

## Usage 

```ruby
#   Example with random numbers
bubble_sort([4, 3, 78, 2, 0, 2])
# => [0, 2, 2, 3, 4, 78]

#   Example with reversed array
bubble_sort([9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0])
# => [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```
